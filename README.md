 -->

It was cool summer evening as Diana lowered her hood, revealing a scarred face, and entered through the double doors of the tavern, *Highway Drop*. She had been alone for a long time now and voices of men and women laughing and sharing the important matters of the day filled her heart with a little joy.

She looked around the Highway Drop and saw merchants negotiating deals, farmers discussing weather as the begin to sow new crops. She saw couples kissing each other in one of the darker corners. Diana smiled to herself and walked towards the bar on the far left side of the tavern. "Your strongest drink," Diana said lazily as she muled over her life. 

*Where did it all go wrong?* she wondered silently as the bar keep poured her a glass of with brown liquid and called, "Your drink, woman." Diana looked at him from over her eyebrows and shook her head, *He thinks I've no business here.* Taking her drink and finishing it in one gulp she pulled her long sword and slammed it on the bar, "One more." She smiled as the barkeep's expression changed from pure contempt to a more inquiring awe. She turned in her seat and leaned against the bar, inspecting the tavern.

"Tell me barkeep," she swung in her seat to face the barkeep, "what news do we have?" she picked up the drink he had placed on the counter.

Barkeep looked at her while her dried glasses with a wipecloth, "News?" he pretended to not understand her question. Diana gave him a sharp stare that could and he adjusted his behaviour, "There has been some troubles around this parts," he replaced the glass back where it belonged and leaned in closer to Diana, "those merchants at the back would have more details." 

"Bring me another one of these," Diana grabbed her sword and turned, "And bring me some food, I've starving." *A warm soup and fresh bread would definitely life my spirits up.* She crossed the tavern and found a booth close the negotiating merchants.  A one point she'd have considered eavesdropping a violation of privacy, but these days news were exchanged between people in hushed tones in dark corners of a tavern in the middle of nowhere. *If only...* she trailed off. 

"No!" one of the merchants said in a heavy accent of Alcadia, "No, I'll not trade at that price."

"Dear sir," the Dawn merchant wearing his guild's ring shook his head, "It is a fair deal, you don't understand the risks I'm taking to transport your beloved Dawn Whiskey. You see sir, Dawn Whiskey is brewed exclusively in this region. This is goddamned best whiskey in the world." Diana looked at the glass in front of her, *I don't doubt it.*

"What risks," Alcadian merchant raised an eyebrow, "enlighten me."

"You know how things are in Dawn." the Dawnite said rubbing his temple, "Ever since our King, our True King died the country has gone to the dogs, the military has become a group of thugs who harass the citizens. Here's the problem, sir, a group of King's men have found themselves a base in the village that sits between all of Dawn and the snowy peaks where the whiskey is brewed. They've been harassing merchants and anyone who stumbles upon the village.

"I cannot tell you how many times I have found myself naked and robbed. This is the only price I can give you: 3 gold for a gallon of finest dawn whiskey." *3 gold per gallon?* Diana looked at her whiskey, *I'm going to lose a lot of money today.* She shrugged and finished her drink and placed the glass upside down.

"But the price is too high," Alcadian merchant rubbed his beard and twisted his face, "I'll be losing a shit ton of gold"

The barkeep walked up towards them and the merchants fell silent, Diana turned and smiled at them. "White bread and soup with pieces of chicken."

"We've been doing business for a decade now," the Dawnite lowered his voice further and Diana had to concentrate on what they were saying, "In the name of good faith I can go as low as 2 gold and 15 silver for a gallon."

The Alcadian merchant muled over the deal and Diana saw he was very close to accepting the deal so she turned her attention to the soup, *There's nothing more they can tell,* she tasted the soup and found it spicy enough, *I'll have to visit that village, barkeep will know more.* she soaked the bread with soup and enjoyed the meal, *Don't know when I'll be able to get my next meal.* 

"Are you Diana?" a boy walked upto her and asked innocently. 

"Huh," Diana looked up with shock clearly surfacing, "Diana?"

"Are you Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn?" the child stared at her sword.

"No child," she shook her head, "I'm not Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn," *I'm just Diana... Just Diana.* 

"I've seen the drawings of your sword in one of the books my father owns, he owns a lot of them and I like to read them, this is Diana's sword."

"You are mistaken child," Diana pushed sword away from the child's reach, "This sword, this sword nothing like Diana's. If I had an Invincible sword do you think I'd have these scars?" she pointed her scarred face.

The child shrugged, "maybe you got those scars before you found this Invincble Sword," *It is pointless to convince him, I'll have to leave before someone else identifies me.* 

"Here," she handed him a silver coin, "keep this a secret and get yourself something sweet when the markets open." the child smiled and nodded before disappearing in the tavern.

She ran her hand on the hilt of her sword and thought to herself, *Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn-- exciled because of things she did,* she attached the sword to her hip and wrapped her cloak around her tightly and walked up to the barkeep, *I'm Diana the Broken Sword of Dawn.* 

"That'll be 10 silvers," the barkeep said without looking at her.

"Tell you want, I'll give you 15 silvers if you could point me to the village those merchants were talking about."

"How did you come upon that kind of money?" the barkeep leaned on the counter, "Are you a thief? A mercenary?"

"Does it matter?" Durga laid three big silver coins each amounting to 5 smaller silver coins.

"It absolutely does not." barkeep pocketed the three coins, "They were talking about a village roughly 10 miles from her towards the west. You've been very generous to me so I'll give you a tip, don't go there only trouble awaits you."

"Thank you barkeep for your tip," Diana raised her hood up and left the Highway drop to be greated by a setting sun and a lonely 10 mile hike on a treacherous highway. 

---

The empty, treacherous highway allowed her mind to wander of to a distant past, *I was the Invincible Sword of Dawn,* Diana found herself yearning for her past. A cool mountain breeze swept the plain and Diana wrapped her cloak tightly around her. *I've been wandering for far too long now,* she thought to herself, *I left my people, my country undefended and in the hands of...* she looked ahead and saw a distant light twinkling through the mists of the night, *I'm here.*

As she approached closer to the light she checked her sword once and allowed her mind to wander, *I should have never left, I should have continued with my role.* From a cloak pocket she pulled out a long scarf like cloth and carefully wrapped it around her face, hiding her identity from being discovered. *If a boy can identify my sword...* Diana thought as she continued to stalk closer to the village.

Going off the highway and through the tall grass she unhooked her sword from her hip and wondered, *If a boy can identify you,* Diana talked to her sword, *King's men would definitely know who I'm.* Diana surveyed the plain, sword in her hand and a scarf hiding her face. A moment later she found a tall, lone tree towards the north and smiled to herself and changed her course. 

As she approached the tall, lonely tree she found herself yearning for her family, *Tallis, my child, I hope the world is treating you kindly.* a tear bubbled in her eyes as she remembered Tallis waving her goodbye, clutching a book under his arms. *Darius...* she smiled, *I haven't seen you in ages now, I hope you are happy.* 

*Farewell,* Diana kissed her sword, *You've served me well, but for now I need to be on my own.* After toiling for about an hour and covering herself in a thin sheen of sweat she dropped her sword in the hole she had dug and buried it, away from prying eyes, *I'll see you again.* she sighed, rubbing her temple with the back of her hand and began towards the twinkling light of the village.

*Dawn,* Diana steeled herself, *I'll always stand between you and those who want to destroy you.* As she reached the edges of the town she heard drunken laugher cackling through the village and a stench so powerful her scarf couldn't supress. 

"Hector," Diana heard a raspy voice call out somewhere in the distance, and she walked towards the voice, "Yo, Hector, it is your turn." Diana found a group of men sitting around a fire and playing cards. At the edges, where light met the shadows Diana saw royal blue and gold uniform-- heavily soiled-- hanging on a thread. To her right she saw a group of soldiers taking turns in harassing a young girl who had scars all over her body. To her left she saw a child been abused by burly, drunken men.

"Hmmm," Hector looked up from his cards, "Ah, yes my turn." Hector picked one of his cards from his hand and placed on top of discard pile.

"What are we playing for today?" The person who had was supposed to play next asked, "I don't have a good hand!"

Hector chuckled, "Looks like I'm going to win this game. We are playing for our time with the one of the virgins Hob" Hector scratched his beard, "I'm pretty sure Jake's daughter is flowering for the first time."

"She ain't half bad, Hector!" Hob said as they waited for the person sitting opposite Hector to play his turn.

"I don't want time with Jake's daughter if I win." the man finally discarded a card from his hand and collected the pile for himself.

"What are you playing for Lambert?" the man named Hob asked sheepishly.

"I'm going to have fun with one of those young boys!" 

"You do you, Lambert! You do you!" Hector chuckled.

The blood in Diana's veins bubbled to a boil, *These men are using the villagers as commodity, trading their lives, their honor over a game of cards. These aren't men of Dawn.* She wanted to go forward and kill them all in an instant, but she waited, patiently, observing them, understanding them. 

"Todd," Hob called out, "Come now play quickly!"

"You are not my King!" Todd said loudly, "I don't take orders from no one!" After carefully examining his cards Todd discarded one onto the pile.

"Okay, okay!" Hob raised his hand subserviently, "Calm down."

"I'm sick and tired from taking orders from people, 'You must fight for the King. You must sacrifice your life for the King.' I don't want to do sacrifice my life for a puny little king who sits on his throne and fucks anyone with a pair of teats on them."

"Yes!" Hector took his mug and took a big sip, "To be honest, I was a simple blacksmith's apprentice. There was this girl in my village named, Joan, I was going to take her to the barn and make love, but I was drafted to be the King's men. Don't get me wrong, I love fucking one of them virgins, but Joan-- she'll always have my heart."

"Will you guys play or do you want to put our cards down and talk about our past?" Lambert looked at each of them in turn.

"Aye!" Hector looked at the discarded pile, "It is my turn. Tell me Lambert, why are you a deserter? You were the best of us, you were going to make captain."

"I..." Lambert swallowed, "I met a man and I fell in love... But the captain didn't approve and killed him. I tried to continue for a while but eventually I couldn't take an order from him so I deserted."

"Aren't you glad you deserted? You can fuck any man you want and no one's going to stop you now."

*These are good men who did bad thing,* Diana was beginning to forgive the King's men for the atrocities they committed, *Maybe they deserve a second chance. Maybe they need a sliver of light in the darkness they've found themselves in.* Diana thanked herself for not killing them earlier.

---

A twig cracked and Hector leapt to his feet, drawing his short sword and shouting towards the creeping darkness of the forest,"Who's there?"

Hob, Lambert and Todd dropped their cards on the table and drew their swords and raised their shields, "I hope you are not pulling another stunt to see our cards, Hector." Todd said with a rasping voice

Hector ignored his friends adn crept closer towards the shadows, "Who is it?" He looked sideways and spoke angrily to his soldiers, "What the fuck are you standing there for?"

He pointed towards the shadows and the men pulled up their pants and pulled out their swords from its scabbard, "Take out the fire." Hob ordered the men and one by one the burning torches and were extingquished. An eerie, warm darkness engulfed the village. Hector allowed his eyes to adjust to the darkness.

"Hob, Lambert take the flanks!" Hector organised his men into formation and they crept into the dark plains together. The tall grass obstructed their view and so they hacked and slashed their swords in perfect synchrony.

A metallic ring echoed through the dark plains and everyone turned towards the sound, "Found you," Hector smiled when he saw a small figure crouching in the undergrowth. Hector raised his sword and hacked wildly in the pitch black night. A bone cracked and Hector screamed in pain as he collapsed to his knees. The crouching figure rose to its feet and light a torch, revealing a masked face with piercing brown eyes.

"A woman." Hob chuckled, "Hector, you got punched by a girl." 

"Fuck!" Hector winced in pain as he got to his feet, "I'm going to..."

"You would do well to mind your tongue, soldier." The masked woman said in a firm voice.

"I don't take orders from anyone," Hector said,  "I'm a free man!"

"No," the masked figure turned, "No one is free! We are all bound by a social contract! We are all bound by Law. We are all bound by our morality!"

"Bwah!" Lambert spat at his feet, "Don't go talking about morality. We live in a cruel world and only way to survive is to be cruel."

"I'm not here to teach you deserters, philosophy," the masked figure changed the tone of the conversation, "Leave this village, leave these people by sunrise. Think about your sins, think about the atrocities you've committed and repent for them."

"These aren't atrocities," Todd said,  "this is us taking control of puny lives."

"Yes!" Hob joined in, "This is our village!"

"I'm a free man woman," Lambert circled the masked figure running his hands around her waist, "I'll do as I please."

"You have till sunrise." the masked woman disappeared into the tall grass without making a sound.

Todd, Hob and Lambert turned to Hector who was holding his sides and had his face twisted in pain, "Got punched by..."

"Shut up Hob!" Hector shouted, "What are you men looking at? Go after her, you morons." Hector wrapped his arm around Hob's shoulder and leaned against him, "Todd, Lambert, find me that woman!" Hector ordered, "Hob you need to fix me!"

Lambert and Todd nodded to Hector and then to each other before running off in different directions, "What are you going to do when you find her, Hector?"

"I'm going to teach that woman a less."

 -->

Diana pulled back into the tall grass, *They'll be following me.* she heard Hector order his men to search for her, *I need to hide quickly.* she moved gracefully through the grass, making sure not to make a sound.

Before she was exiled, Diana was a warrior, *I still am a warrior,* she thought to herself, *I've done this before.* she recalled challenging a foe too powerful for her. She took a hard left and began to circle back to the village. With blood and death, Diana had learned the best place to disappear from the enemy at the gates was to sneak back into their house.

*They'll never look for me here.* Diana thought as she tiptoed around the village. Her scarf mask and a dark cloak allowed her to hide in the shadows. She looked around the corner of the house and found a soldier taking a leak and she ran across without making a noise. *I've to sneak around a village in my own country...* Diana thought, *I've done this several times, but never in Dawn, never at home...* she thought with a heavy heart.

She surveyed the village from the shadows of two houses built too close to each and found no one around. Tiptoeing across the road, she found an abandoned house with broken windows and a falling roof. She snuggled through the small window and crashed on the other side to find a house robbed, and a family destroyed. Looking around, she found a wooden elephant and chiseled horse. She picked it up and with a smile her thoughts went back to her son Tallis, *He loved elephants... Aren't they majestic? He'd call every time he saw the war elephants relaxing in their stables.*

The moon was particularly bright today and it illuminated the abandoned house with silvery light. *Summers are particularly hard, the nights are bright and skies are clear.* she thought, *But I like the warmth.* She found a small corner in the house that was not draped in silver glow and sat crossed legged. *There was a time, when summers meant bloody wars and winters meant hunkering down for a drawn out siege. Now...* she thought for a moment, *Now summers are food and winters-- long hunger.*

She picked up the block of wood that had shattered from a shelf and pulled out her dagger, *Tallis...* she thought with love only a mother could muster, *Little one... How long has it been?* she whittled the wood away, thinking about her boy, *I hope you've grown to be a strong man.*

Hours passed as she silently carved the wood block into a 5 pointed star. As the sun turned to sky purple first and slowly to blue, she pulled up her mask and covered her face in the shadows of the hood, *My son,* she thought as she delicately placed the carved wood onto the ground and muttered a silent prayer, *Someday we'll meet again, for now, my country needs me.*

Steeling her resolve she followed Hector's voice, "Where is she?" Dianna heard anger and hatred seep in his voice and a pang of sorrow crashed into her, *Hector, child...* she thought, *You should have left this village alone.* As she snuck through the shadows she saw the soldiers harassing the peasants and an anger boiled in her.

"Leave them alone." She ordered a drunk soldier who had lost his pants somewhere as was trying to physically exploit a young girl in her late teens.

"Who are you to order me?" the man stripped the girl's clothes off, "I take orders from myself and sometimes, Hector."

Dianna furiously pulled her dagger out and dashed towards the man, slicing his throat, "This will end today." she sheathed her dagger and handed the girl her clothes, "Take me to Hector." The young girl nervously took her clothes and led Dianna through the snaking streets. They took a corner every once in a while and finally the girl turned and pointed towards a small building, "Thank you child."

As she walked towards the small building she saw deserters guarding it and from inside she could hear Hector's angry voice, "Where is the woman? I asked you to find her, Lambert."

"I'm here Hector." Diana said without lowering her mask or her hood as she stood in front of the small building. A group of five soldiers fell in the defensive stance and someone raised the alarm by blowing into a horn, *Call all the backup you need...* she thought as she stood there patiently waiting for the deserter to show up. The sun had risen above the horizon, feeling the heat, Diana dropped her cloak, revealing a royal blue shirt inlaid with gold threading. Her dagger hung from her hip that fastened her uniform in place. The soldiers swallowed seeing her in Dawnite uniform and stepped back.

Hector walked out of the small building supported by Hob and Todd, "I see..." Hector chuckled, "So you are sent by the King himself..."

"No!" She slowly paced the width of the street. The soldiers noticed the many battle scars on her arms and a tattoo and life drained out of their face and they turned pale.

"This is our village," Hector said, "We own this place and these people." He pointed behind her where the villagers had gathered. She could see they had hope in their heart and fear in their mind.

"You don't own anyone," Diana said, "leave this place and you'll still have a chance to live!"

"A single woman," Hector chuckled, "Against a battalion of war hardened soldiers? You do not stand a chance." Hob whispered something in Hector's ear and his eyes widened and he went pale, "Oh, no ordinary woman..."

"Do not test my patience, Hector" Diana said calmly, "I'm a forgiving woman, but you need to show me you are willing to make a change!"

"Empty words," Lambert said this time, "We deserve this place for all the horrors we've seen... For serving our King and his greed."

"You say," Diana tried to reason with them, "you've seen horror and yet you are a parasite who's willing to feed on these innocent men and women."

"Woman," Lambert said, "Innocent men are fodder for the strong and fearless and women are fertile land to plant our strong, fearless seed."

"We are never leaving this place," Hector said, "And neither are you. Men! Kill her!"

"You disrespect," Diana said as she pulled her dagger and dashed towards the quad, "Everything that Dawn stands for!" She dodged the attack, leaping from one foot to another, sliding between them and slicing anyone who got within her range. She finally made it and stood straight in front of the quad who prepared to pull their swords.

"We are going..." Todd and Lambert said in unison as they went for their sword but Diana kicked them in their knees, shattering them. She pointed her dagger at Hector-- who still stood straight with Hob's support.

"Take your friends and leave." Diana gave them a final chance, "Take them and go back to Capital, join the army back, serve the people of Dawn again."

"After losing our friends, our families, our love to Dawn's greed..." Hector said with a strong, fearless stare,  "After seeing how innocent men and goodness of the heart is rewarded-- I'd rather die here. You said, we disrespected everything Dawn stands for, tell me woman... What do you think it stands for?"

"Fairness, philanthropy and unbreakable bond to fellow countrymen."

"You are wrong-- or at least we don't value them anymore. Now-a-days, Dawnite men only know greed, lust and selfishness." Hector said, "Take my life if you want to, but I'm not going back to being a Dawnite Soldier -- A King's man."

With a heavy heart, Diana sliced the throat, in turn, of Hector, Hob, Todd and Lambert. *May you find peace in the afterlife,* She said a silent prayer kneeling next to them. When she turned she saw the villagers cheering in celebration. With a smile covered by her mask, Diana began to walk away, *This country needs me more than I had thought.* she pondered on the final words Hector has spoken, *Dawnite men only know greed, lust and selfishness...*

"Lady." A young boy with torn clothes and disheveled hair and beard walked up to him, followed by a skinny girl with scratches all over her body.

"Yes?" Diana raised an eyebrow.

"Thank you for freeing us from their oppression." the boy said as the duo went to their knees and kissed the ground.

"It was my duty..." Diana said and turned to leave the village.

"Please," the boy said, "Will you teach us how to fight?"

"I don't have time for this." Diana said, "Go back to your mother and father."

"We don't have one." the girl said, "Our parents died a long time back."

"Go back to doing something useful for the village." Diana waved her hand.

Couple of minutes after she had left the village's farthest edge behind she turned on her heels only to find the sickly girl and disheveled boy following her with a twinkle in their eyes, "What are you doing here?"

"We are following you ofcourse."

"Go back," Diana said, mildly infuriated by them, "I don't have time to teach you."

"We are not going anywhere." the boy smiled, "And it looks like you need us too."

"I don't need a couple of teenagers following me."

"You've been lonely for far too long, Princess."

"I'm no Princess." Diana said, irritated by the duo, "And I'm not lonely."

"Alright,"the girl chuckled, "we are going to follow you. Oh and by the way, I hope you don't mind our dog."

"Ugh," Diana threw her head back in defeat, "Fine, but don't attempt to talk to me or get in my way."

"We won't."

Diana smiled to herself as she faced away from the duo and their dog, *It'll be good to have company... I've been lonely for far too long...*

 -->

The palace of the Indra was located in the very heart of Dawn. The city sprawled around the palace walls and snaking roads criss-crossed through it. Sunrise was still hours away but the Dawnites were out of their bed, bathed and were going off to work. From the huge palace window that overlooked the sprawling city, Wylhem the Indra of Dawn watched his subjects bustling to work. He smiled, *More you work, the more money I'll have to spend.*  

Having revolutionized tax laws by introducing income tax, Wylhem had amassed a massive wealth. He turned away from the window and walked across his bedchamber. The Indra's bedchamber was gigantic with a lofty 20 feet ceiling supported on towering pillars. The bed in his chamber would have dwarfed most rooms in Dawn. He looked at his reflection in the mirror and smiled, *I'm perfect.* he thought to himself. A woman wrapped her hands around his waist and kissed him, *I'm the greatest Indra.* he thought turning around to kiss the woman.

"My Lord," the woman said in a husky seductive voice,  "Allow me to please you."

Indra smiled and pushed her to the bed, "I'm done with you." he found his robe, folded, at the foot of the bed, "Pick this up for me." he ordered the woman who sheepishly obliged and handed him his robes. Wrapping the robe around him he walked to the door, "Get out of here before I return, you are of no use to me." He closed the door behind him and entered the well-lit corridor that interconnected all the rooms of the palace. *I'm not just the Indra of Dawn, I'm...* He walked through the corridor, his hands clasped behind his back and tailed by his mute guards. *Are they really mute?* he thought to himself.

Contrary to popular belief held by the citizens of Dawn and folks in all corners of the world, Indra of the Dawn didn't sleep past noon. "Sir." A balding man with royal blue uniform paused as Indra crossed him, "Hail Wylhem of Dawn." He bowed low and waited for his king to pass. *I'm Wylhem of Dawn?* Wylhem thought and found himself deeply offended by the soldier's remark. He stopped and turned on his heels and found the balding man bowing, *I'm Wylhem of Dawn?* he thought angrily, *No! I'm not defined by Dawn. Dawn is defined by my rule.*

"My Liege?" the soldier said, swallowing.

"How did you address me?" Wylhem asked silently with an icy cold stare.

"Hail Wylhem of Dawn." the soldier swallowed, still bowing low.

"Do you think I'm defined by Dawn? Do you think I don't have an identity without Dawn?"

"I didn't mean to offend you, My Liege." the soldier whimpered, "We've been taught to hail Your Excellency. My Lord, My Liege." the soldier went to his knees, "Please forgive me."

"Guards," Wylhem turned and walked away, "Take his head where it can be seen by his children and his wife. It'll teach them how to respect their... Indra." *I'm more than Indra.* he thought.

Wylhem continued to explore his palace, wondering about his identity, *Am I really Wylhem of Dawn? Am I Indra of Dawn?* paced slowly. The sun had crossed the horizon and yellow light of the morning sun filtered through the windows that lined the palace walls. Wylhem caught a painting from the corner of his eyes and his chain of thought was broken. He found himself looking at a majestic painting of his great-great-great-grandfather, Trafalgar, the first Indra of Dawn. He went closer to the painting and found himself asking, *Who am I?*

Wylhem shook his head and turned only to find two maids walking across to-- *Hmm, they are beautiful.* he pushed his identity crisis away from his mind, *They'll do for today.* He pointed towards them silently and one of the guards methodically broke off from the formation and marched towards the maids. A moment later the two maids followed the guards sheepishly, their eyes staring at their feet.

"My Lord." the curtsied and stood, trembling with fear, "We apologize for any incoveninence we've caused."

Wylhem smiled, "It is quite alright." He lifted their head by their chins and looked them in the eyes, "I just want you to accompany me in my walks today."

"Yes." the two maids said in unison looking relieved. Wylhem turned and continued to walk, he rested his arms around their waists and thought to himself, *I'm the most powerful man in this City. No. I'm the most powerful man in the world.*

Wylhem had slept with the two maids somewhere around fourth hour after noon, "When I come back, I need you to look exquisite and eager to please me." he walked through the long corridor of the palace a second time during the day, his thoughts about his identity had lingered but he suppressed them by lusting for the two maids he had left behind in his chambers, *Oh, I'm going to enjoy myself tonight.* he thought.

"My Lord," a small man with a crooked set of teeth that complimented his crooked nose and a deceitful personality, "We are honored to be in your presence." *Ah, the Snakeman.*

"My Liege," another man with an overly sweetened voice said the man went to his knees and kissed Wylhem's feet.

"Rise," Wylhem said in a flat tone, "Minister Eckerhart"

"Your Highness," A tall man with matted jet black hair and big earlobes bowed stiffly and withdrew to his corner holding a tome under his arms.

*He reminds me of someone,* Wylhem thought as he circled the round table at the very center of the room and took his place at the high, embellished chair, "Let's begin."

One after another his advisors updated him with the daily matters of the Kingdom and Wylhem inattentively nodded, *Do they expect me to burden myself with the trivial matters of the Kingdom?* Wylhem thought. *I'm supposed to be the Indra of Dawn, the most powerful man in this country. I've made this kingdom richer beyond measure. I've won battles and conquered territories.* "We've been hearing rumors about her," Indra heard the Snakeman speak with his characteristic lisp, "She'll be dealt with swiftly and without mercy."

"Rumors about?" Wylhem straightened himself in his seat, almost excited about the daily reports Snakeman presented.

"Traitor Diana," the Snakeman smiled slightly as his eyes glanced across the room to the corner of the matted hair man.

"Hmm," Wylhem waved his hands,  "I assume, if the rumors have any weight, the Traitor will be dealt with." *Diana! Yes! That tall man reminds me of Diana. He has a striking resemblance to her.* One thing led to another and Wylhem found himself thinking about the two maids waiting for his return, *Oh my...* he smiled deviously to himself, *Things I'm going to do to them.*

"Your Majesty," Minister Eckerhart said in his honey coated, delicate voice, "How do you want us to deal with it?"

"Hmm," Wylhem straightened his back and wiped the smile from his face, "Deal with what?"

"Your Majesty," Minister Eckerhart dropped his voice to a whisper, "We've been hearing rumors about a rebellion amongst the nobility of the kingdom that you are too weak to bring Glory back to Dawn. They think the bloodline of Trafalgar the First Indra of Dawn has weakened and it needs to be expunged."

"Hmm," Wylhem rested his chin on the back of his hand and asked in a flat, unnerving voice, "What do you think Minister?"

"About what Your Majesty?"

"Has the bloodline of Trafalgar weakened? Do you think I'm unfit to rule the greatest Kingdom in the world?"

"Your Majesty," the Minister bowed low, "You are the strongest man Dawn has ever seen and you have brought wealth to the Kingdom. Any man who thinks that the blood of Trafalgar has weakened is a fool."

"Hmm," Wylhem nodded, "What do you think is the appropriate action?"

"Whatever Your Majesty decides will be swiftly executed," Eckerhart said softly.

Pleased with the Minister's answers, Wylhem rose to his feet and paced the room with his hands clasped together. "They think I'm weak to bring glory back to Dawn? Organize an exhibition, I'll fight the strongest duelist in all of Dawn and defeat him." Wylhem turned to face his advisor, "And once I've done that, the rebels will face their fate at my hands."

"Your Majesty," Eckerhart nodded. Wylhem turned to his right and exited the room, *they think I'm weak and cannot bring glory back to Dawn?* He went straight to his bedchamber and found the two exquisite maids naked in his bed. Wylhem dropped his clothes and pounced at them, *I'm a strong man, I'm the strongest there is.* By the time he was done with the two maids they lay on his bedchamber's floor, bloodied and covered in scratches all over their bodies.

---

The sun scorched the earth and a cloud of dust had settled over Dawn. Wylhem heard excited voices of people walking through the streets to the Amphitheatre, *Yes,* Wylhem thought to himself as he paced his room near the window, *I can hear them excited about the match.* he thought. As he peered down from his window he saw soldiers in Royal Blue escorting the people to walk on designated streets to the Amphitheater. "This way, if you want a spot in the Amphitheater." A soldier roared pointing towards the east of the palace.

A man walked in his room and sheepishly said, "Your Majesty."

Wylhem turned on his heels and saw a tall, lean man with dark hair stand in a plain white tunic, *peasants,* Wylhem smiled deviously, *they are... mine.* he gestured for the man to get in his bed, "Take your tunic off," Wylhem said plainly as he turned back to face the window. *This will bring in more gold.* he thought as he saw mass of common citizens of Dawn walk towards the Amphitheater, *Make me the richest Indra, peasants.* he thought.

"Your Majesty," the tall man said seductively.

Wylhem drew the curtains of his room and dropped his robe as he walked up to the bed. He jumped onto the bed like a hungry lion, *I'm the Strongest.* he told himself. By the time he was done the tall man was knocked unconscious and barely breathing, "Guards." Wylhem called and pointed to the limp body of his latest prey. He wrapped himself in his robe and exited the room.

Taking one turn after another, the Indra of Dawn reached the throne room where a royal entourage waited for him, "Your Holy Majesty," they went to their knees when he walked into the throne room, "The palanquin is ready."

Indra scanned the room with haughty eyes, *Your Holy Majesty,* Wylhem thought to himself, *Today, I'll ascend to be the God King of Dawn.* Wylhem sat on the Throne of Dawn and looked at his loyal advisors, "Palanquin?" he asked with flat voice and his men looked at each other and swallowed, *You are right to be afraid of your God.* he thought.

"Your Holy Majesty," Eckerhart bowed low and said in his usual sugary voice, "As the Indra of Dawn we prepared a royal Palanquin that'll be carried by the strong men."

Wylhem stared at Eckerhart for a moment before he spoke plainly, "Prepare a chariot..." he paused, "I'll ride to the Amphitheatre on Erawan."

"Your Holy Majesty..." Eckerhart gasped, "He's wild... It is not safe."

Wylhem gave Eckerhart a cold stare and allowed the silence in the throne room to grow, "It shall be done." Eckerhart said when the silence has swollen to become an unbearable presence in the throne room.

Minutes passed and Wylhem heard shouts and screams of agony before Eckerhart walked back into the throne room, wiping his forehead he bowed low. "Your Holy Majesty. He's ready."

Wylhem rose and placed his crown of steel and gold on his temple and crossed the throne room with pride, *Noble and Peasants.* he heard Trafalagar's voice, *They are one and the same-- one cannot exist without the other.*

Outside men were straining to keep Erawan-- the four tusked white elephants from rampaging. Wylhem walked upto the great white beast and ran his hand on his trunk and whispered something and the elephant calmed. The men around him stood stupifed as he climbed Erawan and raised his fist ordering the royal progression to move towards the Amphitheatre.

As the progression approached the Amphitheatre more and more jaws dropped to the ground to see Wylhem riding the great white beast Erawan and people went to their knees as the king passed. From the Amphitheatre Wylhem heard the electrifying cheers of the spectators, *They are here to cheer me on.* Wylhem found his heart thump with excitement. As Erawan entered through the gate of Amphitheater a stunning silence engulfed the electrifying roars. Wylhem wheeled Erawan around as he idly scanned the packed Amphitheatre seats. *I'm your God King,* he thought to himself and for effect he thrusted his fist up in the air and the crowd roared with excitement.

Wylhem descended the four tusked beast and circled the Amphitheatre, "Today," the announcer echoed in a loudspeaker, "Our beloved Indra, His Holy Majesty Wylhem will challenge the strongest gladiator in all of Dawn, the champion of Amphitheatre, Tartarus." stretching around Wylhem waited for his opponent to walk into the arena. "Your Majesty," the announcer approached instead, "The match will begin momentarily."

Wylhem nodded, "Hmm."

"Your Holy Majesty," the announcer swallowed, "Do you think it'll be safer for you to fight in an armor?" he pointed towards the armory.

"I'm the strongest man in all of Dawn." Wylhem looked at him with a sideways glance and the announcer disappeared from his view. *I'm the strongest man. No, I'm the God King. I don't need no armor.* Wylhem looked around and found rebel lords sitting together in a pavilion that gave some respite from the scorching sun. Wylhem smiled at them deviously and turned his attention to the arena.

A tall man, almost seven feet tall with arms as thick as Erawan's trunk walked in with armor of wrought iron. He raised his short, razor sharp sword up and the crowd cheered him on, "Tartarus." the Amphitheatre chanted in unison. Wylhem looked at his citizens with angry stare, *Your King is here and you chant for this monster*

"Bring my sword." Wylhem ordered and his honor guard brought forward an ornate sword with broad blade and a royal blue sapphire embedded in the hilt. Wylhem picked the sword and unsheathed a blue blade and the crowd fell silent once again. "Isn't that... the Invincible Sword of Dawn?" someone whispered, "Yes... that is her sword... The Invincible Sword Of Dawn." Wylhem smiled as he swung the sword around skilfully and fell into an aggressive offensive stance.

Tartarus drew his short sword and fell into a more fluidic stance, "Bring it on." he roared through his helmet, "You may be the King of Dawn, I'm the Champion of Amphitheater."

The two gladiators exchanged a few spars, Tartarus drew first blood when he nimbly parried a heavy blow from Wylhem and cut his thighs in the follow through, limping Wylhem changed his tactic and allowed Tartarus to attack. *He's huge and I can beat him in speed.* Wylhem thought as the two champions circled each other drowning in the cheers from the crowd. Tartarus charged his sword close to his body and in a straight line with his forearm. Approaching Wylhem Tartarus swung his sword hard and thrusted his shield in Wylhem's side.

Tartarus overwhelmed Wylhem with a flurry of swift slashes and perfectly timed stabs, *How can he move so fast?* Wylhem thought as he dodged a slash here and stabbed there. He caught a few with his sword as he struggled to keep up with Tartarus's speed. Wylhem thrusted his shield and it caught Wylhem in the face and cracked his lips. He stumbled back and Tartarus roared, "You can never beat me King of Dawn." Tartarus taunted taking off his helm "You are weak, I don't need these." He undid his armor and swung his sword by his wrist.

Wylhem steadied himself and charged as fast as his bleeding legs allowed. With the Invincible Sword, Wylhem unleashed an attack never before seen, he slashed and hacked at blinding speed, he leapt and wheeled deftly but Tartarus was better. He dodged every attack and managed to dig his short sword three times. Wylhem stumbled backwards and fell to his knees. *How is this possible? I'm... I'm the strongest man. I'm the God King of Dawn. I've the Invincible Sword of Dawn.* Wylhem thought as it occurred, *I'm Dawn...* he smiled as he got to his feet. "Guards." he ordered and raised his strong hand.

His honor guards jumped into the arena and surrounded Tartarus, with skills of hardened soldiers they disarmed the monstrous gladiator and kicked him to his knees. Wylhem walked up to the defeated gladiator as the crowd watched the act in silence with open mouth and teary eyes, "I'm the God King of Dawn," Wylhem said raising the Invincible Sword above his head, "A simple gladiator cannot defeat the might of Dawn." he dropped his sword, beheading Tartarus cleanly.

He looked around the Amphitheatre and a moment later the crowd roared, "Our King. Our Lord." Wylhem smiled as he picked up the head of Tartarus and flung it towards the pavilion of his rebels. *This is what will happen if you ever rebel.* Wylhem told the lords in the ornate tent with his eyes who looked haughty and prepared to leave the Amphitheater.

---

Covered in bandages and a stick to support his limp, Wylhem wandered his palace. A woman followed around him like a loyal companion and smiled seductively everytime Wylhem gazed upon her. *The God King of Dawn.* Wylhem thought and smiled, *I'm their God... They'll build temples in my honor and pray.* From the other end of the palace corridor, Wylhem saw a man approach. *Minister.*

"They are here." Eckerhart said bowing low.

Wylhem nodded and dismissed the woman with a wave of his bandaged hand, "Go wait in my bedchamber." Wylhem ordered. After the match in Amphitheater, Wylhem had sent out a messenger and gathered his lords, rebels and loyals, by inviting them for a feast. *I'm officially going to change my title from Indra to God King.* he had told his advisors who waited for him at the edge of the Arena.

Following Eckerhart through the maze-like corridor of the palace, the two stopped outside an embellished door,  "Your Holy Majesty." Eckerhart bowed low and pointed towards the door.

Wylhem strengthened himself and pushed the heavy door with his bandaged hand. On the other side, the chatting Lords and advisors stopped talking and turned, "Your Holy Majesty," they said in unison and went to their knees. Wylhem nodded and walked in the room with his chin thrusting upwards. While his lords and advisors waited on their knees kissing the floor, Wylhem slowly scanned the room, *Yes. Bow you worthless Dawnites. I'm your God.* he told himself.

Only after seating in his chair that was raised a few inches higher on the ground did Wylhem spoke in a soft, uninterested tone, "Rise." One by one his advisors took their place behind him. The Snakeman stood in the shadows on the right and Eckerhart stood to Wylhem's left. Once everyone had seated and fell completely silent Wylhem spoke once again, "As of this moment, I'm no longer Indra." Wylhem looked at his lords and their faces cheated them with a smile, "I'll be the God King of Dawn.'' He had expected his men to protest at this proclamation. *Yes, you are right to be afraid.* Wylhem thought, *Question your God and you'll face his fury.*

"Let the feast begin." Wylhem waved his hand and servants filled in carrying the delicacies of the feast. He looked at his rebel lords and found them disgusted at the food being served to them, "Yes, eat that pile of shit, Lord Tilman."

"Your Holy Majesty," Lord Tilman turned, "Why am I being served shit?"

Wylhem chuckled and raised his hand and two honor guards brought Tilman to his feet, "You dare question your God King?" Tilman stood there and stared at Wylhem with angry eyes, "You think, the blood of Trafalgar has weakened? Eat that shit for trying to usurp the throne of Dawn and I might spare your life."

"Your Holy Majesty," Lord Tilman said in a flat voice, "I'd rather die and have my honor disgraced."

"Suit yourself." Wylhem looked at his guards and one of them drew his sword and sliced the head clean off the body, "If you dare question my authority over you or Dawn, this is what you'll get." Wylhem pointed towards the bleeding head and pile of shit served on a silver platter.

Reaching back to his bedchamber he jumped on the woman who had been waiting for him. As he satisfied himself by beating the woman bloody a thought occurred to him, *I own Dawn and I can do whatever I want to, just like what I can do to this peasant woman. I can fuck her, I can beat her, I can kill her. I can do whatever I want, I'm the Strongest man there is. I'm the God King. No, to these lowlifes, I'm God.*

"The palace of Dawn was built 7 centuries ago when the tribes of the area had come together and elected the strongest tribesman as their leader who'd usher them into a new age." Tallis told one of the guards who was walking with him to his left, "The Palace was built to weather severe avalanches and remain warm in cold waves."

"Why has the palace aged if it was built 7 centuries ago, Councilman Tallis?" the guard asked as the two continued to walk through the corridor. Sun had just risen over the horizon and Tallis was already making his way to his office sequestered in the northern wing of the palace.

"Ah," Tallis raised his finger as he continued, "Modern building are made from kiln baked bricks, they are cheap but they don't have the strength of chiselled stone. Nature is stronger than us." Tallis tilted his head to his left and continued towards his office. The guard had fallen quiet and the corridor echoed with their footsteps.

"Soldier," Tallis scratched his beard, "Indulge me, what is our Kingdom's biggest issue?"

"Councilman?" Guard's precise march buckled for a moment, "I don't understand."

"Dawn has stood proud for seven hundred years," Tallis sighed, "In that long history we've made mistakes, we've weathered uncertain times but we've always learned something.

"Take for example, roughly three centuries ago Dawn was consumed by draught. Famine soon followed. We lost half our population to hunger and malnourishment, but it taught us a lesson. Do you want to guess what that lesson was?"

"Umm," Guard thought for a moment, "We plan our resources?"

"Excellent," Tallis praised the guard, "We learned to plan our resources, we built granaries to save extra harvest. So Soldier, tell me what would our descendents learn from us?"

"Councilman," Guard paused, "I think our time is up." He pointed towards the door of his office and clicked his heels together and saluated the man before turning 180 degrees and going back the way they came.

*Hmm,* Tallis sighed, *It's a brand new day. It is like being in a prison-- a very big, luxurious prison.* he closed the door of his tiny office behind him and dropped his cloak on to the floor. *Mother,* he looked at Diana's dagger decorating his table and bowed his head in reverence, *Please guide me through these uncertain times.* he took in a deep breathe and sank in his chair.

"Battle of North, a lesson in military tactics." Tallis read the title of the book that lay in front of him before flipping it open to a bookmarked page.

Tallis studied the book carefully, taking in the material about the tortoise formation. *Hmm, generally archers are positioned in the back exposing them to surpise attacks from the rear. It is astonishing why no one ever thought of protecting the archers and bringing them to the center.* the read more about how the tortoise formation had devastated the first wave of enemy attacks.

*So bringing in the archers to the very center and using shields and pikes to defend them crushed two waves of enemy attacks?* Tallis noted it down in his mind, *The only drawback I see of this formation is when attacked by horsemen!* he idly played with the Diana's dagger and continued to analyze the pros and cons of tortoise formation. *Hypothetically, if the archers are able to release volley of arrows at twice or maybe even thrice the current rate and have enough arrows in their quiver...* Tallis took a piece of paper and scribbled something on it, *This sounds promising... if we can create a bow-- an automatic bow that fires arrows at thrice the current rate...*

He continued to read the Tome. He spent hours sitting and analyzing the various dirty tactics Diana used.The sunlight had reached its zenith hours back and Tallis studied the book deligently  *That is bloody brilliant, mom.* he smiled when he read about how Diana dressed a small battelion of her soldiers in enemy uniform and sent them behind the enemy lines.* he paused trying to think of reasons why it won't work now, *Well, for starters, people already know about this tactic. I'm sure Shaedsgard army has secret keywords that'll be used to verify each other's identities. If they don't...* he looked outside the window and saw the shadows in the wrong direction, *Hang on... It's already evening.* 

Getting up from the chair, he moved around his small office to stretch his legs, *I should talk to General Mykel.* he pulled up a loose paper and placed it flat on his desk, *Hmm, he'll have insights on these ideas...* he found his inkwell and dipped his pen in it.

<!-- {Letter from Tallis to General Mykel} -->
As he sealed the letter with a red wax and his family's crest a Trident, someone knocked on his door, *He's early today.* he thought putting the letter securely in his pocket.

"Soldier Harry," Tallis said as he opened the door and paused midsentence, realising it wasn't Harry waiting for him at the door, "Yes how may I help you?"

"I was asked to deliver this to you." the man handed him a bunch of twigs wrapped in hemp string. 

Tallis with a straight face took the twigs with him and said with a pleasant smile, "Thank you, good man!" he closed the door behind him and went back to his desk with twigs in one hand. He undid the string that held the twigs together and aranged them in careful order, *Ah, she's here and wants to meet tonight!* he smiled. It was an genius idea to encrypt messages with twigs. When placed in a certain order the twigs revealed basic messages like time of meeting. *Mom, you've always been a genius!* he thought.

---

The underground tunnels of Dawn were an architectural marvel. Built a millennium ago, these tunnels connected every part of the city to the palace grounds. At first it was used as an escape route in times of uncertainty and political turmoil. But now, they had become a huge threat to the safety of the Palace and the King. *How did they even manage to build this tunnels with archaic technology?* Tallis thought as he walked through the narrow, claustrophobia inducing tunnels.

As he moved through the tunnels he recalled a snippet of text he had read about these tunnels in a book his mom had handed him over when he was little child, *The network of tunnels were built over time a century, the very first one -- the one that I'm walking in right now-- was built to use as an escape route, leading from the palace to the outskirts of the city.* Tallis smiled. 

The flame on his torch fluttered for a moment revealing the end of the tunnel to be close by, *I wonder how she's been doing?* Tallis thought, *Last time I met her she was a terrifying young girl who didn't hesitate a few bones.* he thought as he exited the tunnel and into a moonlit field. 

Looking around he quickly extinguished the torch and walked towards an old temple, *Ah the temple of Alzym-- The God of Darkness-- for without him there wouldn't be light.* Tallis touched the temple walls with a little reverence and circled around to the front. 

"You are late, Tallis.* a raspy voice of a woman who used to scream as a child echoed.

"Emma," he smiled as he was happy to see his friend once again, "It is good to see." 

Emma walked upto him and kicked him in the groin and then laughed heartily, "It is good to see you Tallis, you've grown taller than I could remember.* she compared their heights by standing shoulder to shoulder with him, "Yes a good head taller than I last remember."

"Thank you," Tallis said, he took her hand and kissed it, "You've grown, um, beautiful?"

Emma sat on the staircase that led to the temple inside, "Is that a question?"

"Last I remembered you broke a guy's bones who called you pretty." Tallis sat next to her and they looked at the dark sky together, "No one ever comes here anymore! Alzym has fallen out favor, people worship Kafifa -- the Goddess of Light and eternal bliss. Humans surprise me Emma! People change gods to suite their purpose. They worship to get their 'wants' fulfilled."

Emma listend to him ramble on about how religion that was once an instrument of unity has been causing even greater divide than the world had previously known. Tallis looked at her as he continued to tell her about various books he read on religion and how every religious texts preached the superiority of their god and their way of life, "You are bored." he suddenly stopped.

"No," Emma touched his hands, "continue, please! It is good to listen to you!"

Tallis laughed, "Let's get back to the matter at hand!"

{Emma describing Tallis about the situation in shaedsgard}

By the time Emma had finished narrating her time at Shaedsgard, Tallis' face had lost all it's color, "That is just..." Tallis got to his feet and paced the temple hall, his footsteps echoed, "We... Dawn is not ready Emma."

Emma nodded, "What are you gonna do?"

Tallis looked around and over his shoulders, "The king... The king has been blinded by his ego. His sycophants are feeding him lies of grandeur... No matter, I'll have to bring this to the King, I'll have to raise alarms..."

"Hmm," Emma smiled, "There's one last thing I want to talk about!"

"What is it Emma?" Tallis held her hands.

"I'm in love with you Tallis," Emma said with her usual matter-of-fact voice, "Ever since I was a little girl, I looked up to you. You are brave, you are fiercely loyal, you take care of your people Tallis. You are a perfect man. Will you marry me, Tallis?"

Tallis smiled and embraced her, "Sweet Emma," Tallis sighed, "You know I can't do that... I'm not the man you think I'm."

Emma sighed and slapped him, "You are, you dummy!"

"No matter," Tallis clasped his hands behind his back, "I need to take care of the mess we are in. I need to prepare for the eventuality."

"What are my orders?" Emma stood straight.

"Emma," Tallis turned around to face away from her, "I ask too much of you, but I need you back in Shaedsgard and be as close to General Vyktor as you can. Ideally, it'll be great if he takes you as his lover."

"I'll do it," Emma said confidently, "I can do anything for you, Tallis!" She turned around and marched out of the temple.

Tallis watched his friend go with a heavy heart, *What have I asked her to do!* Tallis thought to himself, *I'm using her to get information.* a tear bubbled in his eyes, *I'm not the man you think I'm Emma! Look what I just did, I sent you off to sell yourself.*

---

The way back to his office was a long one, the torchlight kept him from getting lost along the way. *What am I going to do?* he thought as he snaked through the city underground, *The Indra doesn't trust me... he didn't trust my mother who sacrified everything for the kingdom.* 

As he approached the palace he carefully extinguished the torch and listened for footsteps. A moment later he pushed the stone doors open and squeezed himself into the palace grounds, *If I tell him, I have a spy network in foreign lands... He'll skin me alive.* Tallis scratched his stubble, *Maybe I'll find something in the books.* he chuckled.

Tallis lit a candle in his office and collapsed in his chair, *The fuck, I'm going to do now?* he played idly with his mother' dagger. The room had always felt like home, but today it felt different, distant, *Mom, what would you do?* he thought as he looked around the room and smiled as his childhood flashed in front of his eyes.. He had carefully decorated the office just to look like her mother's study. As a kid, Tallis often snuck into his mother's room to read texts on strategy.

Getting to his feet, he picked up a book from the shelf and idly flipped through, *At this point, if I tell anyone about Emma or my network, I'm done. I need start a rumor, I need the King to hear this from someone else, probably Snakeman or Minister Eckerhart or General Mykel.* Tallis thought, *No... I cannot start a rumor, for one I don't have a network within the kingdom, and second Snakeman would trace it back to me. I need to be discreet.* there was knock on his door and Tallis sighed, *Harry, you've got to leave me be.*

"Sir," the soldier smiled as Tallis opened the door, "Are you ready to leave?" Harry asked, Tallis could see Harry hated this assignment as much as he did.

"Soldier," Tallis stood straight behind the door, "I've work to do, I don't think I can leave tonight."

"Sir," the soldier smiled again, "My orders are to take you back to your house latest by midnight." 

Tallis sighed and opened the door further, "Take a seat while I get ready."

"Thank you sir," Harry stood straight and alert just outside the door, "I can wait right here." 

"Whatever helps you sleep." Tallist said. *The snakeman and Eckerhart are foolish and sycophants, Indra knows that much. I've seen him doubt their advice before, no this info shouldn't come from them.* Tallis wrapped himself in his coat and tucked a tomb on chess under his armpits. "Let's go, son!"

Harry escorted Tallis back to his apartment at the other side of the city, they turned here, slipped onto a moonlit avenue there. *Yes. The intel should definitely come from the General.* Tallis crashed into Harry who had stopped to talk to a comrade. "I'm so sorry, Soldier." Tallis bowed his head.

"Yo," the other nameless soldier raised a hand and gave a casual salute, "I'll see ya at the tavern later tonight." 

"Tavern?" Tallis asked as the two continued to walk through the city.

"Yes," Tallis saw Harry smile, *This one is genuine*, "We soldiers of the 133rd division often hang around this tavern near the barracks for a night cap."

"I see." Tallis, "Don't let me keep you waiting then, son." he opened the door of his house and got behind it.

"Thank you sir," Harry turned around and walked away before circling back to him, "Sir, be good. You are being closely watched."

Tallis smiled wide, "I know. Ever since I was a little kid and they sent my mother away."

"Between you and me sir," Harry looked over his shoulders, "I think Lady Diana was the greatest General the Kingdom of Dawn had ever seen."

"Thank you, Soldier." Tallis gave a weak smile as tears began to well up in his eyes.

Next morning, Tallis woke up earlier than usual and dressed himself for a formal meeting-- wearing the royal colors of the Kingdom. *Ugh...* he sighed as he tried to fasten the cloak over his shoulders. *General Mykel should have received my letter, I hope he's willing to talk to me.* Tallis straightened his hair in the mirror.

He cracked the door open and found the street empty, *Okay, time to make a difference.* he steeled himself. Taking deep breathes he peeled himself out of his house and donned his hood up. *The Kingdom intelligence and police are stupid.* Tallis thought to himself, *They've put me in house arrest but no one mans the door. No one sits around the corner to keep an eye out on me.* Tallis shook his head with disappointment.

General Mykel lived a few blocks away in a house owned by the kingdom. *General Mykel.* Tallis recalled his own childhood, *You were my mother's most loyal lieutenant...* he shook his head and wrapped his cloak tighter, suddenly the air felt colder to him. Tallis looked around and found people beginning to come out of their houses and  go to work, *I need to hurry.* He finally reached General Mykel's house.

Taking a deep breath he rapped the heavy wooden door three times and waited, *General Mykel, I hope you do right thing this time.* he looked over his shoulder, *Not a single man tailing me. Snakeman is using all the resources to find my mother.* He heard footsteps approaching the door and straightened himself.

"Tallis," an old man opened the door, "Good morning, son!"

"General Mykel," he brought his hand forward for a formal handshake, "I have something important to discuss."

"Ah, yes!" General Mykel nodded, "I received your later yesterday. They were some really interesting ideas in their about upgrading our weapon design."

"General," Tallis looked over his shoulder to see no one was tailing him, "this is something else, something far more bigger and important."

General studied Tallis for a moment before pushing the door further open, "Let's talk over a cup of tea. Or do you rather prefer coffee?"

"Coffee works," Tallis swallowed, "I hope you trust me, General. This is a matter of Kingdom's security."

Mykel nodded and put a hand on Tallis shoulder, "I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I've never compromised the security of our Kingdom."
