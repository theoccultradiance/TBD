 -->

It was cool summer evening as Diana lowered her hood, revealing a scarred face, and entered through the double doors of the tavern, *Highway Drop*. She had been alone for a long time now and voices of men and women laughing and sharing the important matters of the day filled her heart with a little joy.

She looked around the Highway Drop and saw merchants negotiating deals, farmers discussing weather as the begin to sow new crops. She saw couples kissing each other in one of the darker corners. Diana smiled to herself and walked towards the bar on the far left side of the tavern. "Your strongest drink," Diana said lazily as she muled over her life. 

*Where did it all go wrong?* she wondered silently as the bar keep poured her a glass of with brown liquid and called, "Your drink, woman." Diana looked at him from over her eyebrows and shook her head, *He thinks I've no business here.* Taking her drink and finishing it in one gulp she pulled her long sword and slammed it on the bar, "One more." She smiled as the barkeep's expression changed from pure contempt to a more inquiring awe. She turned in her seat and leaned against the bar, inspecting the tavern.

"Tell me barkeep," she swung in her seat to face the barkeep, "what news do we have?" she picked up the drink he had placed on the counter.

Barkeep looked at her while her dried glasses with a wipecloth, "News?" he pretended to not understand her question. Diana gave him a sharp stare that could and he adjusted his behaviour, "There has been some troubles around this parts," he replaced the glass back where it belonged and leaned in closer to Diana, "those merchants at the back would have more details." 

"Bring me another one of these," Diana grabbed her sword and turned, "And bring me some food, I've starving." *A warm soup and fresh bread would definitely life my spirits up.* She crossed the tavern and found a booth close the negotiating merchants.  A one point she'd have considered eavesdropping a violation of privacy, but these days news were exchanged between people in hushed tones in dark corners of a tavern in the middle of nowhere. *If only...* she trailed off. 

"No!" one of the merchants said in a heavy accent of Alcadia, "No, I'll not trade at that price."

"Dear sir," the Dawn merchant wearing his guild's ring shook his head, "It is a fair deal, you don't understand the risks I'm taking to transport your beloved Dawn Whiskey. You see sir, Dawn Whiskey is brewed exclusively in this region. This is goddamned best whiskey in the world." Diana looked at the glass in front of her, *I don't doubt it.*

"What risks," Alcadian merchant raised an eyebrow, "enlighten me."

"You know how things are in Dawn." the Dawnite said rubbing his temple, "Ever since our King, our True King died the country has gone to the dogs, the military has become a group of thugs who harass the citizens. Here's the problem, sir, a group of King's men have found themselves a base in the village that sits between all of Dawn and the snowy peaks where the whiskey is brewed. They've been harassing merchants and anyone who stumbles upon the village.

"I cannot tell you how many times I have found myself naked and robbed. This is the only price I can give you: 3 gold for a gallon of finest dawn whiskey." *3 gold per gallon?* Diana looked at her whiskey, *I'm going to lose a lot of money today.* She shrugged and finished her drink and placed the glass upside down.

"But the price is too high," Alcadian merchant rubbed his beard and twisted his face, "I'll be losing a shit ton of gold"

The barkeep walked up towards them and the merchants fell silent, Diana turned and smiled at them. "White bread and soup with pieces of chicken."

"We've been doing business for a decade now," the Dawnite lowered his voice further and Diana had to concentrate on what they were saying, "In the name of good faith I can go as low as 2 gold and 15 silver for a gallon."

The Alcadian merchant muled over the deal and Diana saw he was very close to accepting the deal so she turned her attention to the soup, *There's nothing more they can tell,* she tasted the soup and found it spicy enough, *I'll have to visit that village, barkeep will know more.* she soaked the bread with soup and enjoyed the meal, *Don't know when I'll be able to get my next meal.* 

"Are you Diana?" a boy walked upto her and asked innocently. 

"Huh," Diana looked up with shock clearly surfacing, "Diana?"

"Are you Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn?" the child stared at her sword.

"No child," she shook her head, "I'm not Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn," *I'm just Diana... Just Diana.* 

"I've seen the drawings of your sword in one of the books my father owns, he owns a lot of them and I like to read them, this is Diana's sword."

"You are mistaken child," Diana pushed sword away from the child's reach, "This sword, this sword nothing like Diana's. If I had an Invincible sword do you think I'd have these scars?" she pointed her scarred face.

The child shrugged, "maybe you got those scars before you found this Invincble Sword," *It is pointless to convince him, I'll have to leave before someone else identifies me.* 

"Here," she handed him a silver coin, "keep this a secret and get yourself something sweet when the markets open." the child smiled and nodded before disappearing in the tavern.

She ran her hand on the hilt of her sword and thought to herself, *Diana the Invincible Sword of Dawn-- exciled because of things she did,* she attached the sword to her hip and wrapped her cloak around her tightly and walked up to the barkeep, *I'm Diana the Broken Sword of Dawn.* 

"That'll be 10 silvers," the barkeep said without looking at her.

"Tell you want, I'll give you 15 silvers if you could point me to the village those merchants were talking about."

"How did you come upon that kind of money?" the barkeep leaned on the counter, "Are you a thief? A mercenary?"

"Does it matter?" Durga laid three big silver coins each amounting to 5 smaller silver coins.

"It absolutely does not." barkeep pocketed the three coins, "They were talking about a village roughly 10 miles from her towards the west. You've been very generous to me so I'll give you a tip, don't go there only trouble awaits you."

"Thank you barkeep for your tip," Diana raised her hood up and left the Highway drop to be greated by a setting sun and a lonely 10 mile hike on a treacherous highway. 

---

The empty, treacherous highway allowed her mind to wander of to a distant past, *I was the Invincible Sword of Dawn,* Diana found herself yearning for her past. A cool mountain breeze swept the plain and Diana wrapped her cloak tightly around her. *I've been wandering for far too long now,* she thought to herself, *I left my people, my country undefended and in the hands of...* she looked ahead and saw a distant light twinkling through the mists of the night, *I'm here.*

As she approached closer to the light she checked her sword once and allowed her mind to wander, *I should have never left, I should have continued with my role.* From a cloak pocket she pulled out a long scarf like cloth and carefully wrapped it around her face, hiding her identity from being discovered. *If a boy can identify my sword...* Diana thought as she continued to stalk closer to the village.

Going off the highway and through the tall grass she unhooked her sword from her hip and wondered, *If a boy can identify you,* Diana talked to her sword, *King's men would definitely know who I'm.* Diana surveyed the plain, sword in her hand and a scarf hiding her face. A moment later she found a tall, lone tree towards the north and smiled to herself and changed her course. 

As she approached the tall, lonely tree she found herself yearning for her family, *Tallis, my child, I hope the world is treating you kindly.* a tear bubbled in her eyes as she remembered Tallis waving her goodbye, clutching a book under his arms. *Darius...* she smiled, *I haven't seen you in ages now, I hope you are happy.* 

*Farewell,* Diana kissed her sword, *You've served me well, but for now I need to be on my own.* After toiling for about an hour and covering herself in a thin sheen of sweat she dropped her sword in the hole she had dug and buried it, away from prying eyes, *I'll see you again.* she sighed, rubbing her temple with the back of her hand and began towards the twinkling light of the village.

*Dawn,* Diana steeled herself, *I'll always stand between you and those who want to destroy you.* As she reached the edges of the town she heard drunken laugher cackling through the village and a stench so powerful her scarf couldn't supress. 

"Hector," Diana heard a raspy voice call out somewhere in the distance, and she walked towards the voice, "Yo, Hector, it is your turn." Diana found a group of men sitting around a fire and playing cards. At the edges, where light met the shadows Diana saw royal blue and gold uniform-- heavily soiled-- hanging on a thread. To her right she saw a group of soldiers taking turns in harassing a young girl who had scars all over her body. To her left she saw a child been abused by burly, drunken men.

"Hmmm," Hector looked up from his cards, "Ah, yes my turn." Hector picked one of his cards from his hand and placed on top of discard pile.

"What are we playing for today?" The person who had was supposed to play next asked, "I don't have a good hand!"

Hector chuckled, "Looks like I'm going to win this game. We are playing for our time with the one of the virgins Hob" Hector scratched his beard, "I'm pretty sure Jake's daughter is flowering for the first time."

"She ain't half bad, Hector!" Hob said as they waited for the person sitting opposite Hector to play his turn.

"I don't want time with Jake's daughter if I win." the man finally discarded a card from his hand and collected the pile for himself.

"What are you playing for Lambert?" the man named Hob asked sheepishly.

"I'm going to have fun with one of those young boys!" 

"You do you, Lambert! You do you!" Hector chuckled.

The blood in Diana's veins bubbled to a boil, *These men are using the villagers as commodity, trading their lives, their honor over a game of cards. These aren't men of Dawn.* She wanted to go forward and kill them all in an instant, but she waited, patiently, observing them, understanding them. 

"Todd," Hob called out, "Come now play quickly!"

"You are not my King!" Todd said loudly, "I don't take orders from no one!" After carefully examining his cards Todd discarded one onto the pile.

"Okay, okay!" Hob raised his hand subserviently, "Calm down."

"I'm sick and tired from taking orders from people, 'You must fight for the King. You must sacrifice your life for the King.' I don't want to do sacrifice my life for a puny little king who sits on his throne and fucks anyone with a pair of teats on them."

"Yes!" Hector took his mug and took a big sip, "To be honest, I was a simple blacksmith's apprentice. There was this girl in my village named, Joan, I was going to take her to the barn and make love, but I was drafted to be the King's men. Don't get me wrong, I love fucking one of them virgins, but Joan-- she'll always have my heart."

"Will you guys play or do you want to put our cards down and talk about our past?" Lambert looked at each of them in turn.

"Aye!" Hector looked at the discarded pile, "It is my turn. Tell me Lambert, why are you a deserter? You were the best of us, you were going to make captain."

"I..." Lambert swallowed, "I met a man and I fell in love... But the captain didn't approve and killed him. I tried to continue for a while but eventually I couldn't take an order from him so I deserted."

"Aren't you glad you deserted? You can fuck any man you want and no one's going to stop you now."

*These are good men who did bad thing,* Diana was beginning to forgive the King's men for the atrocities they committed, *Maybe they deserve a second chance. Maybe they need a sliver of light in the darkness they've found themselves in.* Diana thanked herself for not killing them earlier.

---

A twig cracked and Hector leapt to his feet, drawing his short sword and shouting towards the creeping darkness of the forest,"Who's there?"

Hob, Lambert and Todd dropped their cards on the table and drew their swords and raised their shields, "I hope you are not pulling another stunt to see our cards, Hector." Todd said with a rasping voice

Hector ignored his friends adn crept closer towards the shadows, "Who is it?" He looked sideways and spoke angrily to his soldiers, "What the fuck are you standing there for?"

He pointed towards the shadows and the men pulled up their pants and pulled out their swords from its scabbard, "Take out the fire." Hob ordered the men and one by one the burning torches and were extingquished. An eerie, warm darkness engulfed the village. Hector allowed his eyes to adjust to the darkness.

"Hob, Lambert take the flanks!" Hector organised his men into formation and they crept into the dark plains together. The tall grass obstructed their view and so they hacked and slashed their swords in perfect synchrony.

A metallic ring echoed through the dark plains and everyone turned towards the sound, "Found you," Hector smiled when he saw a small figure crouching in the undergrowth. Hector raised his sword and hacked wildly in the pitch black night. A bone cracked and Hector screamed in pain as he collapsed to his knees. The crouching figure rose to its feet and light a torch, revealing a masked face with piercing brown eyes.

"A woman." Hob chuckled, "Hector, you got punched by a girl." 

"Fuck!" Hector winced in pain as he got to his feet, "I'm going to..."

"You would do well to mind your tongue, soldier." The masked woman said in a firm voice.

"I don't take orders from anyone," Hector said,  "I'm a free man!"

"No," the masked figure turned, "No one is free! We are all bound by a social contract! We are all bound by Law. We are all bound by our morality!"

"Bwah!" Lambert spat at his feet, "Don't go talking about morality. We live in a cruel world and only way to survive is to be cruel."

"I'm not here to teach you deserters, philosophy," the masked figure changed the tone of the conversation, "Leave this village, leave these people by sunrise. Think about your sins, think about the atrocities you've committed and repent for them."

"These aren't atrocities," Todd said,  "this is us taking control of puny lives."

"Yes!" Hob joined in, "This is our village!"

"I'm a free man woman," Lambert circled the masked figure running his hands around her waist, "I'll do as I please."

"You have till sunrise." the masked woman disappeared into the tall grass without making a sound.

Todd, Hob and Lambert turned to Hector who was holding his sides and had his face twisted in pain, "Got punched by..."

"Shut up Hob!" Hector shouted, "What are you men looking at? Go after her, you morons." Hector wrapped his arm around Hob's shoulder and leaned against him, "Todd, Lambert, find me that woman!" Hector ordered, "Hob you need to fix me!"

Lambert and Todd nodded to Hector and then to each other before running off in different directions, "What are you going to do when you find her, Hector?"

"I'm going to teach that woman a less."

Diana pulled back into the tall grass, *They'll be following me.* she heard Hector order his men to search for her, *I need to hide quickly.* she moved gracefully through the grass, making sure not to make a sound.

Before she was exiled, Diana was a warrior, *I still am a warrior,* she thought to herself, *I've done this before.* she recalled challenging a foe too powerful for her. She took a hard left and began to circle back to the village. With blood and death, Diana had learned the best place to disappear from the enemy at the gates was to sneak back into their house.

*They'll never look for me here.* Diana thought as she tiptoed around the village. Her scarf mask and a dark cloak allowed her to hide in the shadows. She looked around the corner of the house and found a soldier taking a leak and she ran across without making a noise. *I've to sneak around a village in my own country...* Diana thought, *I've done this several times, but never in Dawn, never at home...* she thought with a heavy heart.

She surveyed the village from the shadows of two houses built too close to each and found no one around. Tiptoeing across the road, she found an abandoned house with broken windows and a falling roof. She snuggled through the small window and crashed on the other side to find a house robbed, and a family destroyed. Looking around, she found a wooden elephant and chiseled horse. She picked it up and with a smile her thoughts went back to her son Tallis, *He loved elephants... Aren't they majestic? He'd call every time he saw the war elephants relaxing in their stables.*

The moon was particularly bright today and it illuminated the abandoned house with silvery light. *Summers are particularly hard, the nights are bright and skies are clear.* she thought, *But I like the warmth.* She found a small corner in the house that was not draped in silver glow and sat crossed legged. *There was a time, when summers meant bloody wars and winters meant hunkering down for a drawn out siege. Now...* she thought for a moment, *Now summers are food and winters-- long hunger.*

She picked up the block of wood that had shattered from a shelf and pulled out her dagger, *Tallis...* she thought with love only a mother could muster, *Little one... How long has it been?* she whittled the wood away, thinking about her boy, *I hope you've grown to be a strong man.*

Hours passed as she silently carved the wood block into a 5 pointed star. As the sun turned to sky purple first and slowly to blue, she pulled up her mask and covered her face in the shadows of the hood, *My son,* she thought as she delicately placed the carved wood onto the ground and muttered a silent prayer, *Someday we'll meet again, for now, my country needs me.*

Steeling her resolve she followed Hector's voice, "Where is she?" Dianna heard anger and hatred seep in his voice and a pang of sorrow crashed into her, *Hector, child...* she thought, *You should have left this village alone.* As she snuck through the shadows she saw the soldiers harassing the peasants and an anger boiled in her.

"Leave them alone." She ordered a drunk soldier who had lost his pants somewhere as was trying to physically exploit a young girl in her late teens.

"Who are you to order me?" the man stripped the girl's clothes off, "I take orders from myself and sometimes, Hector."

Dianna furiously pulled her dagger out and dashed towards the man, slicing his throat, "This will end today." she sheathed her dagger and handed the girl her clothes, "Take me to Hector." The young girl nervously took her clothes and led Dianna through the snaking streets. They took a corner every once in a while and finally the girl turned and pointed towards a small building, "Thank you child."

As she walked towards the small building she saw deserters guarding it and from inside she could hear Hector's angry voice, "Where is the woman? I asked you to find her, Lambert."

"I'm here Hector." Diana said without lowering her mask or her hood as she stood in front of the small building. A group of five soldiers fell in the defensive stance and someone raised the alarm by blowing into a horn, *Call all the backup you need...* she thought as she stood there patiently waiting for the deserter to show up. The sun had risen above the horizon, feeling the heat, Diana dropped her cloak, revealing a royal blue shirt inlaid with gold threading. Her dagger hung from her hip that fastened her uniform in place. The soldiers swallowed seeing her in Dawnite uniform and stepped back.

Hector walked out of the small building supported by Hob and Todd, "I see..." Hector chuckled, "So you are sent by the King himself..."

"No!" She slowly paced the width of the street. The soldiers noticed the many battle scars on her arms and a tattoo and life drained out of their face and they turned pale.

"This is our village," Hector said, "We own this place and these people." He pointed behind her where the villagers had gathered. She could see they had hope in their heart and fear in their mind.

"You don't own anyone," Diana said, "leave this place and you'll still have a chance to live!"

"A single woman," Hector chuckled, "Against a battalion of war hardened soldiers? You do not stand a chance." Hob whispered something in Hector's ear and his eyes widened and he went pale, "Oh, no ordinary woman..."

"Do not test my patience, Hector" Diana said calmly, "I'm a forgiving woman, but you need to show me you are willing to make a change!"

"Empty words," Lambert said this time, "We deserve this place for all the horrors we've seen... For serving our King and his greed."

"You say," Diana tried to reason with them, "you've seen horror and yet you are a parasite who's willing to feed on these innocent men and women."

"Woman," Lambert said, "Innocent men are fodder for the strong and fearless and women are fertile land to plant our strong, fearless seed."

"We are never leaving this place," Hector said, "And neither are you. Men! Kill her!"

"You disrespect," Diana said as she pulled her dagger and dashed towards the quad, "Everything that Dawn stands for!" She dodged the attack, leaping from one foot to another, sliding between them and slicing anyone who got within her range. She finally made it and stood straight in front of the quad who prepared to pull their swords.

"We are going..." Todd and Lambert said in unison as they went for their sword but Diana kicked them in their knees, shattering them. She pointed her dagger at Hector-- who still stood straight with Hob's support.

"Take your friends and leave." Diana gave them a final chance, "Take them and go back to Capital, join the army back, serve the people of Dawn again."

"After losing our friends, our families, our love to Dawn's greed..." Hector said with a strong, fearless stare,  "After seeing how innocent men and goodness of the heart is rewarded-- I'd rather die here. You said, we disrespected everything Dawn stands for, tell me woman... What do you think it stands for?"

"Fairness, philanthropy and unbreakable bond to fellow countrymen."

"You are wrong-- or at least we don't value them anymore. Now-a-days, Dawnite men only know greed, lust and selfishness." Hector said, "Take my life if you want to, but I'm not going back to being a Dawnite Soldier -- A King's man."

With a heavy heart, Diana sliced the throat, in turn, of Hector, Hob, Todd and Lambert. *May you find peace in the afterlife,* She said a silent prayer kneeling next to them. When she turned she saw the villagers cheering in celebration. With a smile covered by her mask, Diana began to walk away, *This country needs me more than I had thought.* she pondered on the final words Hector has spoken, *Dawnite men only know greed, lust and selfishness...*

"Lady." A young boy with torn clothes and disheveled hair and beard walked up to him, followed by a skinny girl with scratches all over her body.

"Yes?" Diana raised an eyebrow.

"Thank you for freeing us from their oppression." the boy said as the duo went to their knees and kissed the ground.

"It was my duty..." Diana said and turned to leave the village.

"Please," the boy said, "Will you teach us how to fight?"

"I don't have time for this." Diana said, "Go back to your mother and father."

"We don't have one." the girl said, "Our parents died a long time back."

"Go back to doing something useful for the village." Diana waved her hand.

Couple of minutes after she had left the village's farthest edge behind she turned on her heels only to find the sickly girl and disheveled boy following her with a twinkle in their eyes, "What are you doing here?"

"We are following you ofcourse."

"Go back," Diana said, mildly infuriated by them, "I don't have time to teach you."

"We are not going anywhere." the boy smiled, "And it looks like you need us too."

"I don't need a couple of teenagers following me."

"You've been lonely for far too long, Princess."

"I'm no Princess." Diana said, irritated by the duo, "And I'm not lonely."

"Alright,"the girl chuckled, "we are going to follow you. Oh and by the way, I hope you don't mind our dog."

"Ugh," Diana threw her head back in defeat, "Fine, but don't attempt to talk to me or get in my way."

"We won't."

Diana smiled to herself as she faced away from the duo and their dog, *It'll be good to have company... I've been lonely for far too long...*
